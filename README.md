# Random Password Generator
## Description
The purpose of this project was to build on the HTML and CSS provided by adding functional JavaScript code. The end goal was to produce a random password generator that allows users to select what types of characters they want to allow (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) in any combination they choose, at a password length of their choosing (between 8 and 128 characters), all at the click of a button. 
## Usage
* Users can click the 'Generate Password' button to begin generating their random password.
* If a user selects a non-numeric character, or a password length that is too small or too large, they are met with a message about the password criteria.
* As the user follows the prompts, they can select what character types they would like to include.
* If no choice is made, the user is met with a prompt indicating they must make at least one choice to proceed.
* If the user selects a password length that fits the criteria and makes at least one character type selection, a random password is displayed in the box.
